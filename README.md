Chest cancer detection model is to develop deep learning of cancerous lesions in chest CT scans. By using an advanced image processing and deep learning techniques, the project aims to accurately identify and classify cancerous regions. This project demonstrates how efficiently machine learning models, convolution neural networks detect cancerous lesions through Chest CT scans.
